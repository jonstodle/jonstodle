        <title><![CDATA[Does IsolatedStorageSettings persist through an app update?]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>This was a question I ended up asking myself as I was about to push my first update to <a href="http://quotelistapp.com/">Quote List</a>. My first thought was "Yes", that seems the logical answer. The data that I put there are persistent through application launches and I've made sure the code to handle this data checks whether there's data stored already, to prevent overwriting existing data.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the updating of an app doesn't touch the data stored in IsolatedStorageSettings. So, as long as you've written proper code that checks for existing data and prevents the app to overwrite said data if it's present, there's no worry.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_3_1429625168973_1207">Of course this is the expected and probable behavior, but the fact was; I couldn't find anyone actually confirming this on the web. So my goal with this (rather short) post is to aid the next aspiring developer who wonders the same thing: Does IsolatedStorageSettings persist through an app update?</p>]]></bodyText>

<p>I was developing a stupidly simple application for personal use and came up with a humorous idea. I wanted the application title on top of the app pages to also show the version. However I didn't want to add code to every code-behind file to make it so. I came up with the idea of adding the string, used as the application title, to the application resources. Then I used a simple binding to make it all happen.</p>

<p>This worked excellently, but; I didn't want to add the version to the resources everytime i updated the application. Of course this is a bit lazy since it's not that much of a hassle, but there's something a bit more cool about it updating by itself.</p>
<p>To make this dynamic I needed to do some coding in C#: To get the version number of the application i fetched the version number of the assembly. The version number of the assembly is set by right clicking the project in Visual Studio and click Properties. From there you click on Assembly Information and edit the version numbering there. The resources are represented by a ResourceDictionary and I tried this approach:</p>

<p>This didn't work to well though. Every time I tried doing this, a NotImplementedException was thrown at me. After some googling around it turned out that the setter for entries in the ResourceDictionary only does this one thing; throw an NotImplementedException. I went onto the big, wide interwebs and asked on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12032973/setting-application-resources-through-c-sharp">Stack Overflow</a> if anyone knew an answer. After some tips from some brilliant minds, I got inspired and came up with a solution.</p>
<p>Adding new resources to the application isn't a problem, nor is removing them. All I had to do was to remove the resource with the key "ApplicationTitle" and add it again with the new string.</p>

<p>This didn't yield the right result either. It did work if I navigated to another page in the application. As it turns out, you see; the resources are not dependency properties, which means they don't send an event for changes made in the object. That's why the application title does not update in MainPage.xaml. This is however easily remedied by putting the previous code into the Application_Launching event handler which launches before the PhoneApplicationPage is even called, as per the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff817008(v=vs.92).aspx">Windows Phone execution model</a>.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_3_1429625168973_1258">That's how I finally managed to get a "dynamic" application title without having to add code to every PhoneApplicationPage I make, I only have to bind the title of the page to the application resource.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[iOS 9 app switcher switches direction]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Fore some reason, the app switcher in iOS 9 has changed direction: The most recent app is shown in front and the older apps are shown stacked behind each other towards the left, as shown in the image below:</p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 375px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1055/app-switcher-ios9.png?width=500&amp;height=375" alt="iOS 9 app switcher" rel="3074" /></p>
<p> This has also been the norm on Windows Phone and it's app switcher: the older apps are shown to the left, with the most recent rightmost in the list, as shown here:</p>
<p><img style="width: 281.25px; height: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1057/app-switcher-wp8.jpg?width=281.25&amp;height=500" alt="Windows Phone 8.1 app switcher" rel="3076" /></p>
<p>I believe this to be the right order to sort apps. It makes more sense to most of the western world. We read from left to right and progression is associated with left to right movement.</p>
<p>If you observe in films, you'll see that the journey (or progressing travels) happen from left to right on the screen. Going from right to left however symbolises the journey home (or something going backwards).</p>
<p>In my mind sorting the apps from most recent to the right, and the least recent to the left, shows the users digital journey through apps. If they want to find an app they've used in the past, "travel" to the left and find it, just as you would find something previously read in a book to the left.</p>
<p>That's why I am confused as to why Microsoft has changed the direction of the app switcher in Windows 10 Mobile to the one iOS had before:</p>
<p><img style="width: 300px; height: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1056/app-switcher-w10m.png?width=300&amp;height=500" alt="Windows 10 Mobile app switcher" rel="3075" /></p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile is still not done, and they may change it, but it seems like a bit of a backwards step. There is however one positive thing to say about the change: it easier to reach the previous app if you're holding the phone in your right hand. (Which should be a win for all those who don't like navigation to be in the top left corner.)</p>]]></bodyText>

        <title><![CDATA[Will the PDK clean up Android?]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>That's the simple fact of it, no. Android's problem isn't just the fact that the hardware isn't getting the latest updates it's the fact that the hardware vendors have the freedom to do what the they want. Of course, this is one of the great advantages of Android and the devices that run it; the great diversity and choice. There's an Android device for everyone.</p>
<p>The problem however is that some of the hardware vendors (read all) think they can do a better job than Google designing Android. One of the best examples of this is the HTC One X: HTC has altered the way multitasking is handled in the operating system, making it much more aggressive to close apps, resulting in frustration for some power users. According to them the added feature produces unwanted behavior. For most users though it should result in better battery life, which is something Android is notoriously bad at.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not all hardware vendors considers themselves hardware engineering geniuses and leave a lot of the designs of Android to Google, and stick to making smaller, cosmetic changes and improvements. Some adding tighter and/or better integration with different services to differentiate themselves from the competition. While this might a good thing in theory, it adds confusion in reality: one of the strengths of the iPhone or Windows Phone devices is a consistent experience. If you pick one device up, there's no confusion to use it; if you've used one before, you'll know how to use this one too.</p>
<p>In the early days of Android I didn't mind this customization too much, I agreed with the hardware vendors: Android is far from perfect, let's help Google make it better. As both years and versions has passed by, Android has gotten better and better, even at integration with other services. I'm the first admit that Android still isn't perfect is something as close to it as can be. I think that it's finally surpassed iPhone and Windows Phone hasn't caught up quite yet. Windows Phone is at the place where Android was a <a href="http://xkcd.com/1070/">few</a> years ago.</p>
<p>With the legendary 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, release of Android, the mobile operating system finally grew up and become not only beautiful, but also polished; more so than ever before. The UI didn't only look good and distinct without looking like something designed in the early 2000s, it actually looks modern and sleek. The experience was snappy (at least on the devices I've tried) and it felt like something that could seriously compete with the iPhone. At this point Android had also surpassed the iPhone when it came to features, the place it should have. Android was made for a lot of features and it's finally there, the iPhone can't keep up and shouldn't; the iPhone is not the device with all e features one. An think of, it the device that looks good while using it.</p>
<p>The recently announced 4.1, Jelly Beans, will add some features that the iPhone did better, and refine and improve some that the iPhone still doesn't do as well. With 4.1 Android suddenly became tempting again to me. I stopped using Android two years back and didn't think I'd never want to go back, but Google proved me wrong. With the announcement of the new version, there was also the announcement of the PDK, Platform Development Kit, an SDK for hardware vendors.</p>
<p>The PDK is Google's latest attempt to make hardware vendors port their custom software into the newest version of Android at a much quicker pace, something that I don't think is the main problem. The main problem is the customization itself, in my mind the only proper Android experience is on the Nexus line devices. I would only call Android on other devices a passable experience and sub-par to the one you'll be having on a "proper" Android device. While I'd admit that the Improved battery life of the One X is preferable, but the rest of the experience is not desirable to the default one on the Nexus devices.</p>
<p>All in all, I don't think that Android can be "saved" from the hardware vendors, but it can be properly experienced on the Nexus range. Although I'm mostly invested in Windows Phone myself, I can't deny that I have a general interest what's going on in the "enemy" camps. There's nothing more that I want, than to other platforms to succeed at something, making the competitors scrambling to make something comparable, that's called innovation and progress.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_3_1429625168973_955">I dont think that Android can move away from it's current situation but it'll push it's competitors to make improvements and continue to make better experiences and products.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <title><![CDATA[UWP ListView without highlighting and stuff]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>When designing one of my apps I wanted to use a <strong>ListView</strong>, but not have the items highlighted when the mouse pointer was hovering over them. You can see the highlighting below:</p>
<p><img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1064/listview-with-effects.gif?width=480&amp;height=360" alt="ListView with effects" rel="3084" /></p>
<p>After some googling I found that the highlighting happens in the <strong>ListViewItemPresenter</strong>, which turns out to be pretty hidden. It's located inside the <strong>ControlTemplate</strong> of an <strong>ListViewItem</strong>, which is the <strong>ItemContainer</strong> for the <strong>ListView</strong>. The simplest way I've found to disable the effect is to simply override this <strong>ControlTemplate</strong>:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jonstodle/2020d387957c3dd84378.js"></script>
</p>
<p>By switching the <strong>ListItemViewPresenter</strong> for a <strong>ContentPresenter</strong> you may have to do some styling differently, but it shouldn't be too much of a hassle. After all the <strong>Button</strong> uses a <strong>ContentPresenter</strong> to show it's contents. After the switch you'll get something like this:</p>
<p><img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1065/listview-without-effects.gif?width=480&amp;height=360" alt="ListView without effects" rel="3085" /></p>
<p>The only "side effect" is that if the user taps or clicks on one of the items in the list, it will scroll the whole item into view (as far as it's possible). I don't think this necessarily is a drawback, as it makes it easier for the user to see the whole item if (s)he wants to.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <title><![CDATA[WrapPanel with full width columns]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to have a grid of elements where the elements spanned the whole available width. Basically I wanted the same result you get when you set the <strong>ColumnDefinitions</strong> of a <strong>Grid</strong> to have equal width:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jonstodle/130ae1c04750edac3f62.js"></script>
<p>However, I needed it to be more dynamic than a <strong>Grid</strong>. I wanted to be able to set a number of columns and then just supply a set of items. Kind of like a <strong>GridView</strong>, but with elements always filling the whole width.</p>
<p>To get this working I made a custom panel which takes a number of columns and then arranges all the children within the available width, stretching them equally.</p>
<p><img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1067/uniform-width.gif?width=480&amp;height=360" alt="Uniform width" rel="3089" /></p>
<p>I made a new panel which inherits from the <strong>Panel</strong> class. I called it <strong>UniformGridWrapPanel</strong>. I made a <strong>DependencyProperty</strong> called <strong>MaximumColumns</strong>, which is an <strong>int</strong> that keeps track of the desired amount of columns. I then overrode the <strong>MeasureOverride</strong>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jonstodle/c808ae68fa58e050c2c5.js"></script>
<p>I make the panel use the whole available width and the calculate the width of the columns. I also keep track of the row height, which is the height of the tallest element in the current row. This makes sure that the row below doesn't overlap the one above it.</p>
<p>If the child count of the current row exceeds the number of columns, I make a new row by adding the height of the current row to the final size of the panel. I set the new row height to be the current element (since it's the talles element on the new row) and reset the child count. Last I add the final row's height to the final size of the panel and return it.</p>
<p>I did the <strong>ArrangeOverride</strong> like so:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jonstodle/c37c7cac514521ca7d6b.js"></script>
<p>I do much the same here as in the <strong>MeasureOverride</strong>. Here I use the row child count to multiply it by the column width: the first child has index 0, which when multiplied will give an x coordinate of 0. The next child will be moved 1 column width to the right. Apart from that it's much the same.</p>
<p>In UWP apps you can use an <strong>AdaptiveTrigger</strong> to set the column count on the panel based on how much room you've got.</p>
<p><img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/1066/uniform-width-adaptive.gif?width=480&amp;height=360" alt="Uniform width adaptive" rel="3088" /></p>
<p>The whole class can be found on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonstodle/ff4621c4e78ecebe1466">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just as a warning - the panel does not use virtualization. If you put a lot of elements inside, the performance is not going to be good.</p>]]></bodyText>
